# Mental Mentor

## Project description

Mental Mentor is a web application which is a platform for connecting patients and therapists. Once a patient registers, they are led to take a questionnaire that assesses the area in which they struggle the most (for the purpose of this demo, we tested for 3 categories – mood (depression/anxiety/etc.) issues, family issues, and addiction issues.  We then suggest a therapist from our database who specializes in that same area and provide that therapist’s contact information to the patient so they can seek treatment.  Therapists are able to register so they are listed in our database and able to be matched to patients.
